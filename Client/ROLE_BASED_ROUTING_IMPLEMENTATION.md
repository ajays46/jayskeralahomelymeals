# Role-Based Routing Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides automatic role-based routing after user login. Users are automatically redirected to their appropriate dashboard based on their assigned roles.

## How It Works

### 1. Login Process
When a user logs in successfully:
1. The `useLogin` hook receives the user data including roles
2. User information is stored in the Zustand store
3. The `getDashboardRoute` function determines the appropriate dashboard route
4. User is automatically redirected to their role-specific dashboard

### 2. Role Priority System
The system uses a priority-based approach for users with multiple roles:

1. **ADMIN** (highest priority) → `/jkhm/admin`
2. **SELLER** → `/jkhm/seller`
3. **DELIVERY_MANAGER** → `/jkhm/delivery-manager`
4. **DELIVERY_EXECUTIVE** → `/jkhm/delivery-executive`
5. **Default** → `/jkhm` (home page)

### 3. Files Modified

#### New Files Created:
- `src/utils/roleBasedRouting.js` - Core routing logic
- `src/components/RoleBasedRoutingTest.jsx` - Test component
- `ROLE_BASED_ROUTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

#### Files Modified:
- `src/hooks/userHooks/useLogin.js` - Updated to use role-based routing
- `src/components/Login.jsx` - Removed success popup (automatic redirect)
- `src/App.jsx` - Added test route
- `src/pages/HomePage.jsx` - Added test link

## Usage

### For Developers
The role-based routing is automatically applied when using the `useLogin` hook. No additional configuration is needed.

### For Testing
1. Navigate to `/jkhm/test-routing` to test the routing logic
2. Add/remove roles to see how different role combinations affect routing
3. Use the test component to verify routing behavior

### For Production
1. Remove the test link from `HomePage.jsx`
2. Remove the test route from `App.jsx`
3. Remove the `RoleBasedRoutingTest.jsx` component
4. The role-based routing will work automatically for all users

## Technical Details

### Role Constants
The system uses these exact role names (case-sensitive):
- `ADMIN`
- `SELLER`
- `DELIVERY_MANAGER`
- `DELIVERY_EXECUTIVE`
- `USER`

### Routing Logic
```javascript
export const getDashboardRoute = (roles) => {
  if (!roles || !Array.isArray(roles)) {
    return '/jkhm'; // Default fallback
  }

  // Check for admin role first (highest priority)
  if (roles.some(role => role.toUpperCase() === 'ADMIN')) {
    return '/jkhm/admin';
  }

  // Check for seller role
  if (roles.some(role => role.toUpperCase() === 'SELLER')) {
    return '/jkhm/seller';
  }

  // Check for delivery manager role
  if (roles.some(role => role.toUpperCase() === 'DELIVERY_MANAGER')) {
    return '/jkhm/delivery-manager';
  }

  // Check for delivery executive role
  if (roles.some(role => role.toUpperCase() === 'DELIVERY_EXECUTIVE')) {
    return '/jkhm/delivery-executive';
  }

  // Default fallback for other roles or no specific role
  return '/jkhm';
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Routing**: Users are automatically taken to their appropriate dashboard
2. **Role Priority**: Clear hierarchy for users with multiple roles
3. **Consistent Experience**: All users follow the same routing pattern
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Centralized routing logic in one utility file
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new roles and routes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Routes**: Allow users to set preferred landing pages
2. **Role Combinations**: Support for specific role combination routes
3. **Dynamic Routes**: Load routes from configuration files
4. **Analytics**: Track which routes users are being sent to

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **User not redirected**: Check if roles are properly set in the login response
2. **Wrong dashboard**: Verify role names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. **Route not found**: Ensure the dashboard route exists in `App.jsx`

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user roles in the Zustand store
3. Test routing logic using the test component
4. Check if the target route exists in the routing configuration

## Security Considerations

1. **Route Protection**: All dashboard routes are protected by `ProtectedRoute`
2. **Role Validation**: Server-side role validation should be implemented
3. **Access Control**: Ensure users can only access routes they're authorized for

## Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test component that allows you to:
- Test different role combinations
- Verify routing logic
- Understand the priority system
- Debug routing issues

Access the test component at `/jkhm/test-routing` during development.
